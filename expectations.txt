I agree with what Oliver has said since it is also similar to my expectations for this course. I only forgot to mention my hope for a commendable grade, but that is also one of my goals (uno cutie!! hehe). It is good to know that Oliver shares the same sentiment, hoping for our section to build strong mutual support throughout this semester.
